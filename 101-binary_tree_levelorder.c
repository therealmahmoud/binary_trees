/* Write a function that goes through a binary tree using level-order traversal

Prototype: void binary_tree_levelorder(const binary_tree_t *tree, void (*func)(int));
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to traverse
And func is a pointer to a function to call for each node. The value in the node must be passed as a parameter to this function.
If tree or func is NULL, do nothing */
